#  Unit 5 Challenge: Password Generator
An application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected


## User Story

As a developer, I've been tasked with creating a JavaSript application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected


## Acceptance Criteria

I will have met the brief when the following acceptance criteria are met:

Create JavaScript code that will:

    Generate a password when the button is clicked.

    Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

    Length of password:

    At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

    Character types:

    Lowercase

    Uppercase

    Numeric

    Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

    Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

    Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.


## Installation

No particular installation requirements. Web page can be viewed using Chrome, Firefox, Safari or most other standard browser, using "Inspect" Console to see the output
